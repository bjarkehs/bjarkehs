<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Hello, I'm Bjarke, a {{ "1990-04-08" | getAge }} year old college student at Aalborg University in northern Jutland, Denmark. I was born and raised in Hjørring, however, a city 40 kilometers north of Aalborg.</p>
<p>As of Spring 2011, I am studying Software Engineering at AAU as a fourth semester student. Under the News Feed you'll find the projects I've done in previous semesters. Hopefully, this will give you a good idea of the range of work I've been exposed to so far.</p>
<p>Under Follow Me, you'll see other outlets I use on the internet. I'd encourage you to visit my blog for a few laughs, but also to get to know me.</p>
<p>I've created this page with the intention of introducing myself to you. A "hub" of my online shenanigans, and, most importantly, a means to let future employers see my wide range of work and familiarize themselves with Bjarke Søndergaard. I hope it's served its purpose.</p>
