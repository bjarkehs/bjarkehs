<p>Hi, I'm Bjarke. I have a middle and last name, but I only ever go by my first name, even though it's terribly difficult to pronounce. I'm a developer by heart. Toying with code and new technologies are the things I enjoy the most. This means I've played with both the backend for several websites but also created standalone applications for PCs and smartphones. Some languages I favor when developing are; Ruby, PHP, Objective-C, Java, and Erlang. I have picked most of these up from my studies at Aalborg University, where I got my bachelor in Software Engineering and currently working on my masters.</p>
<p>I'm work as a freelancer "slash" consultant and take in work when my studies allow for it. Challenges are what drives me. If something is too trivial to create it is not something I'd like to do. I constantly challenge myself to improve, to create more difficult things, while also demanding more of myself.</p>
<p>When I develop I strive to write clean code. Why? Because if my code is messy it makes it more difficult for both me and others to read it later and thus more difficult to maintain.</p>
